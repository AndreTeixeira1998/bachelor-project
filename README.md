Indoor Positioning Algorithms on Matlab

This project includes codes I have implemented for my B.Eng. degree in Computer Software at (Qazvin Azad University)[http://qiau.ac.ir/en]

The aim of the project was to get inspiration from localization methods such as the ones implemented on mobile robots in order to find position of mobile devices indoors. In the case of indoor positioning, the problem is a little simplified compared to a localization problem.
